This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and finalized with Expo Web.

# Demo

- https://pwa-expo-web.netlify.com/
- https://pwa-expo-web.now.sh/

## Available Scripts with Expo Web

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:19002](http://localhost:19002) to view Expo service in the browser.

The page/app will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
